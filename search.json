Gaming? Reading? One activity that I would want to take up is painting. When I say painting, I mean follow in the footsteps of the iconic Bob Ross of course. Bob Ross is known for his series of relazing painting videos that anyone can take up. But what makes them so relaxing? Is it the paintings themselves, or is it the way Bob Ross speaks? By exploring this Bob Ross dataset and using the Youtube APi to analyze the videos of Bob Ross, I hope to answer these questions.\nhttps://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bob-ross"
